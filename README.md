  ## Description
  This node application simulates common functions of a social networking site. It relies on a User and Thought model which can each have their own friends and reactions respectively.

  ## Installation
  Run npm i to download the mongoose, express, and momentjs dependencies.

  ## Usage
  The routes to access the database can be run through a program such as insomnia or postman. Users can be created and accessed as a whole or singularly by their ID's. Thoughts, which are similar to posts or statuses, can be created in the same way and can have reactions posted to each thought. Users can be added as friends to other users as well.

  ## Contributing
  This application provides a full backend for a prospective social media site and only requires a user-friendly front end developed for public access.

  ## Tests
  The routes for this application can be tested in postman, insomnia, or similar programs.
